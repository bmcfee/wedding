Finally, we wanted to email today to answer a few questions we have been getting:

If I haven't booked a hotel yet, where should I stay?

What type of clothes should I pack?
June in New York is early summer, and the temperature and hovers between 70 and 80 degrees F.
The wedding is outdoors. There is also a lake, so plan accordingly.

How should I dress for the ceremony?
We love to see you all looking and feeling fabulous, so semi-formal attire is encouraged for the ceremony. However, any attire is welcome if it makes you feel like celebrating!

Are you registered somewhere?

Thank You,
